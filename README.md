## Collected information

## Advertisement and Other Third Parties

None of the information stored is shared with any third parties.

## Security

The security of your information is important to us, but remember that no method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure. While we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.
